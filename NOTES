Close rules
-----------

* Use ref counters instead of current pointers
* Close should not return errors
* Errors should not close
* Shutdown events should be propagated up and not acted on except by object owner
* Close should _only_ be done by owner
* Object should wait for child close events, before execting the private close_final

Todo
* read consumes
* response write (compound literals?)
* chunked data
* streaming data
